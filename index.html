                    Hello and welcome to my presentation about running a real factory on WebSockets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of presentations about HTML5 and the new web technologies. Many
                    of them are focused on creating games, how to create semantically correct markup
                    and how to add audio and video. Recently these talks have shifted focus and now
                    many start to talk about cooler stuff like WebSockets. However most of these
                    talks are quite theoretical and often come to the conclusion that the
                    technologies are not ready to be used yet. I'm using these technologies today
                    and I thought it would be fun to show you how they can be used to create
                    something quite different.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Joakim Kemeny and I work as a consultant at Callista Enterprise here
                    in Gothenburg. My native tongue is Java but for the last couple of years I've
                    been specializing more and more on front end development so now it's mostly
                    JavaScript, CSS and maybe some Objective-C, if I'm lucky. But as you will see in
                    this presentation all of these languages are connected today so you will see
                    both some Javacode as well as some JavaScript so I hope that doesn't scare you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This presentation is based on the project that I'm currently working on and I
                    will tell you a little bit more about it as we go along but before we get too
                    technical we need to answer the following question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is a real factory?
                </p>

                    Well, there are all kinds of factories. Behind me you can see the boiler of a
                    paper mill. It's actually the silhouette of the paper mill in BÃ¤ckhammar where I
                    grew up and where I earned my living during the summers. It doesn't quite make
                    me an expert in factories but as least I know what a factory can smell like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So there are many different kinds of factories but one thing they all have in
                    common is hardware.

                    Silos, Pipes, Mixers, Conveyor belts... Coffee Makers. All kind of different
                    hardware. But when I will talk about a factory today I mostly care about these
                    two.

                    ...the input/output units and the programmable logic controllers. This IS a
                    factory to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The I/O units lets me talk to the hardware in the factory, it lets me read the
                    current value of a scale, it lets me send commands such as empty scale and this
                    can be very helpful when you are trying to control a factory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PLC is used to control I/O units and to create sequences that actually can
                    be used to produce something useful instead of just filling and emptying scales
                    at random all day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other half of a factory is software.

                <p>
                    This is what I and I guess most of you do all day long. We create software. And
                    the software in case of a factory can be used to control the factory, to handle
                    customers and orders, analyze samples of what the factory produces and a whole
                    lot of other things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is what I will talk about today. We obviously need to talk to the PLCs but
                    how that can be done in a smart way is the subject for an other talk so I won't
                    touch on that today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So let's see what I'm going to cover today.

        <!-- Scope -------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

        <div id="scope-1" class="step" data-x="2000" data-y="0">

            </ul>

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    I'm going to cover three things. First I'm going to talk about managing orders.
                    List, add and cancel for instance. I guess that this is not what you came for
                    but it will lay the groundwork for the rest of the presentation and I actually
                    think that you will find this part to be more interesting than you think.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="scope-2" class="step invisible" data-x="2000" data-y="0">
            <ul class="option-list">
                <li>
                    <span>1</span>Manage orders
                    <span>List orders, Add order, Cancel order</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>2</span>Produce stuff
                    <span>Controlling the factory and monitor its state</span>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    Next I will be talking about producing stuff. In my current project we are
                    building software to run concrete factories but I have simplified it for this
                    presentation to just let the factory produce undefined stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where it will start to look and feel like a factory and since this
                    whole presentation will be based on demos you'll get to see both the code and
                    the actual running result.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="scope-3" class="step invisible" data-x="2000" data-y="0">
            <ul class="option-list">
                <li>
                    <span>1</span>Manage orders
                    <span>List orders, Add order, Cancel order</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>2</span>Produce stuff
                    <span>Controlling the factory and monitor its state</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>3</span>Create a UI
                    <span>Shouldn't be that hard</span>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    And finally I will show you how you can create a UI to handle this. And it
                    shouldn't be that hard, right?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will be creating the UI and producing stuff at the same time so they will not
                    be as separated as they are in this slide. But it's just to give you an
                    overview.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope this sounds interesting because I've already taken up some of your time
                    so let's get started for real.

                    It usually involves a client and a server and the order system in the factory
                    I'm building today is no different.

                <p>
                    There is nothing special about this at all and it can be solved using a normal
                    REST API as I guess that many of you are familiar with. It doesn't matter what
                    kind of technology you use on the server side here, choose the one you are
                    comfortable with. But in the demos I will use Spring MVC because that's what we
                    are using in our solution.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Rest API ----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

        <div id="rest-1" class="step" data-x="5190" data-y="0">
            <h1 class="small">Spring MVC</h1>
            <pre><code data-language="java" data-src="src/rest-1.java"></code></pre>

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    So we have a normal Spring MVC controllers. It produces JSON and not HTML and
                    this is very important because we have not discussed how to create the UI yet.
                    Maybe it's only web, maybe we will create a native iOS or Android client.
                    Maybe the web isn't at all suited to run a factory so we need to create a normal
                    windows application? The server should not care about that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can list orders with a GET request to /api/order
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can create orders with a POST request /api/order
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="rest-2" class="step" data-x="5190" data-y="600">
            <pre><code data-language="java" data-src="src/rest-2.java"></code></pre>

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    We can update orders with a PUT request /api/order/{id}
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can delete orders with a DELETE request to /api/order/{id}
                </p>
                <p>
                    So that is our server API and it is pretty strait forward. Let's take a first
                    look at our demo application to see how this API can be used.

        <!-- Demo --------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

        <div id="demo-1" class="step" data-x="6690" data-y="0">

                <p>
                    So this is the demo application that we are playing with today. The application
                    is going to be handling orders and it will also be able to run these orders
                    through the factory and follow the order on it's way and also control the
                    factory to some extent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So you can see the list of orders here. The orders have a target customer, a
                    quantity and a status that will be used later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can add a new order here, edit the order and finally also delete an order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So this is the application that we are going to build on today. There are some
                    other buttons here that I will demonstrate later but let's go back.

                    WebSockets is a way to solve this problem since WebSockets can be used to send
                    commands in both directions. So the server can send information to the client
                    even if the client haven't asked for it.

                <p>
                    And WebSockets is part of all the new cool technologies that is part of HTML5.
                    This means that it's available in most modern browsers. To only exception is
                    the default Android browser but you can use Chrome or Firefox instead. The
                    protocol have been stable since april so implementers are starting to catch up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So this means no plugins, so no Flash and no Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's also very firewall friendly since a socket connection is initiated over a
                    normal http request which is upgraded to a WebSocket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the main reason why this is so great for running a factory is...

                <p>
                    ...that it's bidirectional and uses full duplex so we can send messages in both
                    directions at the same time. This is of course necessary to be reliable in this
                    kind of environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And the second thing is that it adds minimal overhead. Just a start and a stop
                    byte for each message and if you compare this to the normal HTTP headers that
                    adds around 1000 bytes it's a huge deal.

                <p>
                    Let's look at how this can be implemented.

                <p>
                    There is no official standard for Java yet. They are working on it through
                    JSR-356 but so far we are left in the hands of the different application
                    server vendors. Both Glassfish and Tomcat have there own implementation but we
                    use Jetty for our solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Jetty implementation is based on the Servlet API but instead of doing a
                    doGet we do a doWebSocketConnect when the client requests a WebSocket
                    connection. The only thing we need to do in the servlet is to return a WebSocket
                    to the client. We can return different WebSockets depending on the protocol but
                    in our case we always return the same type and we pass it a reference to a
                    WebSocketManager which is a utility class that we have created.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what does this WebSocketClient look like.

                    First of all it implements a OnTextMessage interface. WebSockets can be both
                    binary and text based and we use text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interface only have 3 methods. First onConnect where we store the actual
                    connection to the client and then we add the client to a list of active clients.
                    You will see why we need that later but let's just say that it's pretty useful
                    to keep a list of all connected clients.

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    Next we have onClose where we just deregister the client.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final method in the interface is onMessage and this method gets called when
                    the client sends a message to the server over the WebSocket. In our case we
                    delegate the parsing and handling of that message to our utility manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally we've also added a sendMessage method here which just sends a message
                    over the connection that we stored earlier. This is the method that we use to
                    send messages from the server to the client.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So this message, what does that look like? That's up to you but we've created
                    a simple JSON protocol that we use and it looks like this.

                <p>
                    So here we have the message for our orderCreated event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have specified a sub protocol that we use to be able to send different kind
                    of messages over the same WebSocket and in the command we have specified the
                    type of the event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally we have the actual data of the event and here we have the details for
                    the created order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's see how we can use this in our controller.

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    Let's first inject the WebSocket utility manager that we used earlier and
                    remember that we registered all of our clients through this manager and that
                    means that in our createOrder method we can call a broadcast method on the
                    manager to send a message to all connected clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe you wonder how this manager is implemented but this presentation contains
                    a lot of code and it's not done yet so I'm not going to show it to you. Instead
                    I encourage you to checkout the code at my Github page after this presentation.
                    I have to warn you that this is demo code so be aware of that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So now we have a way to communicate from the server to the clients but I said
                    that WebSockets is bidirectional so how do we implement that?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well we already have an API to communicate from the client to the server and
                    that is the REST API so what we did was that we reused that.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="ws-code-6" class="step" data-x="9690" data-y="0">

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    So back to the top of the controller again and what we want to do is to be
                    able to call all methods over the WebSocket connection as well and since we use
                    annotations for everything else we created a couple of annotations for that as
                    well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So we annotate the Spring controller to make it respond the order protocol and
                    then we also annotate the method to make it handle the list command.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Behind the scenes we use some reflection magic but I'm not showing it to you but
                    the same as before, the code is available so check it out. I just wanted you to
                    know that it's possible to combine REST with WebSockets in a nice way.

                    So here we have the demo again. Let's bring up a different browser and to make
                    this a little bit more interesting. I'll use my phone to prove that I'm not
                    cheating.

                    So now we have created the server part for this application using REST,
                    WebSockets and Spring MVC. Next we need to create a UI to handle this and since
                    the client for this application is going to be a web application it will be
                    written in JavaScript but that is not an excuse for writing bad code so we need
                    a good way to structure our code.

                <p>
                    Backbone.js is one of these new cool MVC-like libraries that have popped up
                    in the last couple of year. They don't follow the model view controller pattern
                    precisely instead they use some kind of variation and are normally called MV*
                    libraries or frameworks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of alternatives out there today. Ember, Angular, Knockout and
                    Spine are some of the frameworks that you could checkout. So which one do you
                    choose? Well it's the same as in the Java world, it depends. We choose Backbone
                    since it seemed like the best choice at the time. Today I would seriously
                    consider Ember but I leave that to you. I know that Backbone works so I will
                    show you that today.

                    Backbone have three parts that work together. First we have the models and

                    Orders and customers are some examples of models.

                    know when there is a new order, when an order is changed or when an order is
                    deleted.

                    Next we have views. Views are responsible for showing the models and other

                </p>
                <p>
                    And since the models trigger events the views can listen to these events and

                    Finally we have routers which are kind of the controllers in the MVC-model. The
                    routers are used to map URL to a state in the application by getting the correct
                    models and showing them in the correct views.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a very brief introduction to Backbone and if you want more information
                    you'll have to check it out your self at backbonejs.org.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So let's start using Backbone by seeing how it can consume our REST API. For
                    this we use the models and collections.
                </p>

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    Here you can see the order model. The only thing we have to do is to specify the
                    endpoint for our REST API to let the model and collection know where to get and
                    store the data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this example I've also added some default values for new models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When our models and collections are created, we can use them call our API.

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    Let's start with listOrders. The only thing we have to do is to create a new
                    order collection and simply call fetch to get all orders.

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    Next we can create a new order model, pass it some values and simply call save
                    to POST it to the server.
                </p>
            </div>

        <div id="backbone-9" class="step" data-x="6690" data-y="2335">

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    We can change a value and save it again to PUT the update on the server.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="backbone-10" class="step" data-x="6690" data-y="2445">

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    Finally we can delete the order by calling destroy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's how easy it is to consume our REST API from Backbone. The next step is
                    to add WebSockets to the client as well.
                </p>

        </div>

        <div id="ws-code-7" class="step" data-x="5190" data-y="2000">
            <h1 class="small">WebSockets (JavaScript)</h1>

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    So first a look at the JavaScript API for working with WebSockets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you can see, the interface is almost identical to the Jetty implementation on
                    the Java side. We have onopen, onclose, onmessage and a send function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But in the same way and for the same reasons that we abstracted away the
                    WebSocket stuff in Spring MVC we can make this easier to use for Backbone as
                    well. For Spring MVC we used annotations but for Backbone we implement one
                    WebSocket handler and let it communicate with the Backbone models using events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's see how that can look.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div id="backbone-11" class="step" data-x="3690" data-y="2000">
            <h1 class="small">WebSockets (Backbone)</h1>
            <pre><code data-language="javascript" data-src="src/backbone-6.js"></code></pre>

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    So here we have the order collection again.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div id="backbone-12" class="step" data-x="3690" data-y="2220">
            <pre><code data-language="javascript" data-src="src/backbone-7.js"></code></pre>

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    All Backbone object have an initializer and we can use this to add event
                    listeners. So here we can listen to events on the WebSocket handler and when
                    an event with the protocol order and the command created is triggered we can use
                    the data to update the model in the collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, there is more code here that you don't see so but its just to give you an
                    idea of what you can do and you can find the code at Github as I said earlier.
                </p>

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    Ok. Back to our demo application again. Now it's time to see what the factory
                    looks like for real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So here we have the factory. Remember that we are producing undefined stuff and
                    to do that we take some amount of the different materials A1-A3 and B1-B4 and
                    mix it together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So in this factory we have silos with the different materials. These materials
                    are measured on two scales and when the correct amount have been measured the
                    scales are emptied into some kind of mixer that we don't show in the demo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we click on the scales they are activated. Let's run an order through the
                    factory to see how it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So how does this work? Back to the overview again.

                    The clients can also send commands to the server that gets forwarded to the PLC
                    to maybe activate the scale as I did in the demo.

                    So now we have models that are in sync but as the application continues to grow
                    the UI to show the models may get out of hand so the final piece for this puzzle
                    is to create some kind of way to automate UI changes as well and for that we
                    use Knockout.

                    I mentioned Knockout earlier but I didn't choose to use it as the base for our
                    application since it's not really good for that but for managing the UI it's
                    great. Knockout does its magic though two features.

                    ...and it does automatic UI refreshes. So we can tell the UI how it should be
                    connected to the models and then we don't need to care any more, it will stay
                    updated.

                    So now we have both Backbone and Knockout how can that work?

                    The glue that we use is called Knockback. I just thought I let you know since
                    it complicates the code quite a bit but as usual when it gets complicated I
                    leave it as an exercise to you.

                    So here is some of the code for showing the order list. We can iterate over all
                    orders in a table, bind the value of the properties of the order and even change
                    the css based on the status of the order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also use it to do event handling. This can be done in both Backbone and
                    Knockout but we choose to go with Knockout.

            <div class="notes">
                <p>
                    Here is an other example and this is from the factory part. We show or hide the
                    factory, and we do that animated, when we click on the button as you saw
                    earlier. We also change the width of the scale progress bar based on the
                    progress.

                    So that was the last demo and it's time to go to the conclusions. This was not
                    an all Java talk as you may have hoped for but this is the way applications work
                    now. Now we have an API that we can use from JavaScript as I've shown you today
                    but you could just as easy have created a native app. So stop caring about JSF,
                    GWT or whatever framework is cool on the Java server side today. This is the
                    future.

                    It takes some really hard work to pull it of and the frameworks and tools really

                    Next problem is that JavaScript itself and the different implementations has its
                    limitations. Especially the event loop and the single threaded nature of
                    JavaScript can be really tricky sometimes.
