# Presentation.WebSockets.Factory

This is the presentation files and demos for the presentation **Running a real factory on WebSockets**

## Abstract

Audio and video tags are great. Using header and article to make the web more semantic is really welcome. But the real benefit of using HTML5 comes with all the new techniques and API:s. One of the most interesting is WebSockets.

WebSockets will let you create a whole new category of web applications. In this presentation Joakim will use the experiences from one of his projects to answer the question: Is it possible to run a real factory using Java, JavaScript and WebSockets? Hint: Yes, it is and it works great; Joakim will show you how.

## Known issues

* The presentation crashes Safari for iPad.
* The presentation doesn't work in Internet Explorer and Opera.
* The presentation doesn't look good in Firefox.
* The source code doesn't show in Chrome unless served from a web server.

Long story short: It's made for Safari, I present it using Safari so Safari is probably the best way to watch this presentation :-) Maybe I'll fix it in the future, maybe not.
